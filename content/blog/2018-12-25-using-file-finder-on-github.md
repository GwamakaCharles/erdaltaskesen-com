The first time I started to use Sublime Text I love the `âŒ˜ + p` shortcut
combination. I really change the way I switch between files. After Github, I
started to read codes on Github a lot.

Of couse you can use the search in this repository feature but it is slow and
not good about listing files names.

Today I have discovered wonderful keyboard shortcut on Github: `t`

<!--more-->

Just one key, just press t on any repository.

You may find a lot of other keyboard shortcut on the link at the sources section
