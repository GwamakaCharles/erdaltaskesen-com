There are a lot of ways to generate random values. But some of them are not
suitable for secret keys. There is a new module named secrets in version 3.6 and
later. You can use the code below to generate cryptographically strong random
values.

```python
import secrets
secrets.token_hex()
```

<!--more-->

This module will generate truly random values not pseudo-random. Pseudo-random
generators should be used only for simulation, not important random values or
anything security related. You can use secrets for data such as password,
security tokens and etc.
