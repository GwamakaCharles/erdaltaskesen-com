These folder and files are generated by python. You should add these to your
VCS's ignore file. But if you need to clean these manually, you can do with the
command below:

{{< highlight python >}}
find . | grep -E "(__pycache__|\.pyc|\.pyo$)" | xargs rm -rf
{{< /highlight >}}

<!--more-->

This command will remove all files that end with .pyc and `__pycache__` folder
recursively in the current directory. If you are using this command a lot, you
should think about adding it to your *sh alias list.

Note: For Python 3, you only need to remove `__pycache__` folder because .pyc
files are inside them.

Alternative: You can prevent the generation of the file in the development using
the environment variable below:

{{< highlight python >}}
export PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=""
{{< /highlight >}}
