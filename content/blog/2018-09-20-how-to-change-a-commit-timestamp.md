You may need to change the DateTime of a commit in some situations. For example,
some countries use daylight saving time period and because of it, some of the
commits can have the wrong timestamp.

{{< highlight bash >}}
git commit --amend --date "Thu Feb 15 22:37:31 2018 +0300"
{{< /highlight >}}

<!--more-->

You should commit the real one first, then you can change the timestamp later.
