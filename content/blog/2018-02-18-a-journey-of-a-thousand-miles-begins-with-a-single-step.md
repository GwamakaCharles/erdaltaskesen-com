Some of you may have noticed that I've been building my website/blog for a long
time. Even some of those have been pestering me about it.

In 2008, I bought my domain to make my personal website. Since then, I have
built this website using different kinds of tech stacks, from static to drupal.
Well, it took me over 10 years, but finally, I'm here with a flask website. You
may find details of my stack below.
