The Kindle is a revolutionary device that changes the reading habit of a lot of
people including me recently. Everything works flawlessly when you purchase a
book from the Amazon store.

Not every book exists in the store and sometimes you find the same book in a
different vendor at a much cheaper price. The problem starts here. All the
beauties of having kindle disappear in this situation. In this post, I will help
you prepare your books for Kindle.

## Step by step Instructions

1. Download the book in any format you want. If you have a chance to download in
  `.mobi` format, prefer it. Because amazon' e-book format, AZW, is based on 
  `Mobipocket`format.
2. Add the book to Calibre app using the `Add books` button
3. Click `Convert book` and convert it to AZW3 by choosing `Output format: AZW3`
  (Be sure to select `AZW3`, not `AZW`)
4. Click `Edit metadata` and remove all format but `AZW3`
5. Click `Download metadata` on the same window and download necessary metadata.
6. Be sure you don have any `mobi-asin` tags. You are allowed to have tags of
  `isbn`, `amazon`, `google`, and `goodreads`. **NOTE:** Use kindle version if
  you want to update your reading status at GoodReads from Kindle UI.
7. Install `Quality Check` plugin inside the Calibre app
8. Hit `Quality Check > Fix > Fix ASIN for Kindle Fire`. Don't worry this will
  work for PaperWhite as well
9. Eject the devices from File Manager and enjoy the full integration with
  GoodReads as if you have purchased through the Kindle store.

**P.S.** Never ever download warez book. It's theft, but that doesn't stop
everyone. Some people claim that they can't afford to pay for it, some just
don't care. Think about the author. Writing a book can take months if not years.
So go head and buy it, even if you have downloaded it from somewhere first.
